# LFRun
Run (As Admin) for Windows 10

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuzFaltex/LFRun/master/preview.png "Preview")

This app is a drop-in Run replacement for Windows 10. Assuming I can get it to work, `win`+`r` will launch the Microsoft Run prompt while `win`+`shift`+`r` will launch the LuzFaltex run prompt.

**Please note** This app is a non-functioning alpha build. The current code will only display a message box reflecting what you input. This disclaimer will be removed when the app is functional.
